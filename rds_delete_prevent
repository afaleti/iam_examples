To prevent the deletion of an 
AWS RDS database with a specific tag, you can use the following IAM policy:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DenyDeleteRDSDatabaseWithTag",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": [
                "rds:DeleteDBInstance",
                "rds:DeleteDBSnapshot"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:rds:<region>:<account-id>:db:<db-name>",
                "arn:aws:rds:<region>:<account-id>:snapshot:<snapshot-name>"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "rds:db-tag/<tag-key>": "<tag-value>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}


Replace <region>, <account-id>, <db-name>, <snapshot-name>, <tag-key>, and <tag-value> with the appropriate values for your AWS environment.

This policy denies the DeleteDBInstance and DeleteDBSnapshot actions on the specified AWS RDS database and snapshot resources. This means that users or 
roles with this policy attached will be unable to delete the specified RDS database or snapshot if it has a tag with the specified key-value pair.

You can attach this policy to the IAM roles or users who should not have permission to delete RDS databases with the specified tag.


o prevent the deletion of AWS RDS tags, you can use the following IAM policy:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DenyDeleteRDSTags",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "rds:RemoveTagsFromResource",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "rds:db-tag/<tag-key>": "<tag-value>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}


Replace <tag-key> and <tag-value> with the key-value pair of the tag you want to protect from deletion.

This policy denies the RemoveTagsFromResource action on all AWS RDS resources when the resource has a tag with the specified key-value pair. This means that users or roles with this policy attached will be unable to remove the specified tag from any RDS resource that has it.

You can attach this policy to the IAM roles or users who should not have permission to remove tags from AWS RDS resources.
