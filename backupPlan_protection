According to what we can read in the documentation (Vaults locked in governance mode can have the lock
 removed by users with sufficient IAM permissions), I would like to create a user account that will have 
 permissions to remove the lock while ensuring that none of the other administrator accounts have such permissions.

How should I configure permissions on the privileged account and on the other administrator accounts?

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/vault-lock.html

Short answer is to restrict which can "backup:DeleteBackupVaultLockConfiguration" https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsbackup.html#:~:text=DeleteBackupVaultLockConfiguration

Probably want to layer an Organizational SCP with DENY with condition ArnNotEquals for the arn of the user who you allow to delete the vault lock.

Make sure to replace <region>, <account-id>, and <vault-name> with the appropriate values for your AWS environment.

This policy denies the DeleteBackupVault, DeleteBackupVaultAccessPolicy, and DeleteBackupVaultLockConfiguration actions
 on the specified AWS Backup vault resource. This means that users or roles with this policy attached will be unable to 
 delete the specified backup vault or modify its access policy or lock configuration.

How do I prevent an IAM role from deleting production database backups in AWS Backup

To prevent an IAM role from deleting production database backups in AWS Backup, you can use an IAM policy that explicitly denies the backup:DeleteBackupSelection and backup:DeleteRecoveryPoint actions for the specific resources associated with your production database backup.

Here's an example IAM policy that you can customize with the appropriate values for your environment:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DenyDeleteProductionBackups",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": [
                "backup:DeleteBackupSelection",
                "backup:DeleteRecoveryPoint"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:backup:<region>:<account-id>:backup-plan:<backup-plan-id>",
                "arn:aws:backup:<region>:<account-id>:recovery-point:<recovery-point-arn>"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "backup:ResourceTag/Environment": "Production"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

In this policy, the Deny effect is applied to the backup:DeleteBackupSelection and backup:DeleteRecoveryPoint actions on the resources associated with your production database backup. The Resource field specifies the ARN of the backup plan and the ARN of the recovery point. The Condition field applies the policy only to resources with the Environment tag set to Production.

By attaching this policy to the IAM role associated with your backup users or processes, you can prevent accidental or malicious deletion of your production database backups.
