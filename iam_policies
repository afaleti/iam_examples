Replace <tag-key> and <tag-value> with the key-value pair of the tag you want to protect from deletion.

This policy denies the DeleteTags and CreateTags actions on EC2 instances, volumes, and snapshots with a specific tag. The Condition block limits the policy to only apply when the specified tag is present on the resource being acted upon.

You can attach this policy to an AWS Organizations SCP to enforce it across multiple AWS accounts in your organization.
